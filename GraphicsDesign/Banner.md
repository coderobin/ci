Will print banner here: https://www.solopress.com/roller-banners/pull-up/

size: 2000 x 800mm

Since we don't know about the original background colour of the print material. It's better to have colours all over to avoid surprise.

1. From top to bottom, could use a gradient, top could be some light cyan, bottom might be orange/red, (from our company name: CodeRobin, robin as the bird which has distinct colour patterns). How the transition goes would rely on your professional judgement.

2. We have a company Logo in SVG/png that needs to be at the height of average person's eye height.

3. We also have a product logo that needs be at the centre of lots of other things.

4. We could use a Tree to connect all these together, the tree is specific to as in The Lord of the Rings. Search on Google here: https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=lord+of+the+ring+tree+illustration&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjq7tPYqcTbAhWKJ8AKHcVNCvUQ_AUICigB&biw=1286&bih=618&dpr=2
Caution: only borrow the idea, not exactly copy it due to copyright protection!

5. The product is a software app: https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9ntphrk6qlfg we want to surround the product logo with 5 aspects of it. Following are the things we need to present:

I. Source: GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, VSTS, Coding
II. Language: C#, Java, C, C++, Python, Go
III. Annotation: Text, Voice, Ink, W3C
IV. Sharing: P2P, IM, Group
V. Search: Full-Text, Semantic

So above should be 5 clusters. Connected either by the tree mentioned above, or you can come up with fancy design then we could also remove the tree. The product logo/name should be connected/centered with the 5 clusters.

We probably need to add a catch word someone.

I'll help you to find suitable logos for above 5 clusters.

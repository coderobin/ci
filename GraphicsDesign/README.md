# Company Logo

## Background:

We started the company to do creative work in the software world. We want to focus on making software that is innovative, unique, fundamentally important and useful, in the sense that it will help a group of users, even the industry, to move forward towards better understanding of business problems and improved productivity.

The company name is a combination of "Code" with "Robin". 

"Code" is used here like "Coding", to represent our software nature; it also shows that our main business activity is programming. It's more of a verb than a noun. It does not mean "code" as in "code name ..." or "morse code".

"Robin" is the bird, not the comic hero. Referencing from the WikiPedia page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_robin) we would like to emphasis the following points:

> * The European robin (Erithacus rubecula), known simply as the robin or robin **redbreast** in the **British Isles and Ireland** is a **small** insectivorous passerine bird.  
> * ... with an orange breast and face lined with grey, brown upperparts and a whitish belly.  
> * Male robins are noted for their highly aggressive territorial behaviour. They will attack other males that stray into their territories, and have been observed attacking other small birds without apparent provocation.  
> * More recently, the robin has become strongly associated with Christmas, taking a starring role on many Christmas cards since the mid 19th century. The robin has appeared on many Christmas postage stamps. An old British folk tale seeks to explain the robin's distinctive breast. Legend has it that when Jesus was dying on the cross, the robin, then simply brown in colour, flew to his side and sang into his ear in order to comfort him in his pain. The blood from his wounds stained the robin's breast, and thereafter all robins got the mark of Christ's blood upon them.  
> * In the 1960s, in a vote publicised by The Times, the robin was adopted as the unofficial national bird of the UK. In 2015, the robin was again voted Britain's national bird in a poll organised by birdwatcher David Lindo, taking 34% of the final vote.  
> * ... A small bird is an unusual choice, although it is thought to symbolise agility in darting around the field.

* We would like to derive the colour palette from the colours of the bird
* The main colour should be **orange** or similar
* Keywords: small, aggressive, British, Christian, agility

## Design hints:

* Not necessarily must be a bird in the image. 
* Should be abstract, modern.
* Needs to suit: Website (favicon, Avatar of various sizes), Mobile and Store App, Name Card, Stationary, printing.
* Colourful, but still can handle pure colour and black & white situations.

If a bird will appear, **do not** assimilate Twitter [https://twitter.com](https://twitter.com), Bower [https://bower.io/](https://bower.io/) as both are well known in software world.

Can feel digital, binary, easily relates to programming, software.
